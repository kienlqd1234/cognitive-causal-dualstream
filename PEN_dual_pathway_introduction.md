# Introduction

## General Background

Financial markets are complex systems influenced by numerous factors, including economic indicators, company performance, and public sentiment. Predicting stock price movements has long been a central challenge in financial research, with traditional approaches relying primarily on historical price data and technical indicators. These classical methods, while valued for their simplicity and interpretability, often fail to capture the nuanced information contained in unstructured data sources such as financial news, social media, and corporate disclosures. Recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning have enabled researchers to incorporate textual data into prediction models, significantly improving forecasting accuracy. Studies have demonstrated that investor sentiment, news events, and social media discussions can substantially impact stock prices, sometimes even preceding observable price movements.

## Specific Background

The integration of textual and price data for stock prediction has evolved through several generations of models. Early approaches treated these data streams independently, applying separate models before combining their predictions. More recent hybrid models process both data types simultaneously, typically using attention mechanisms to identify relevant text. The Prediction-Explanation Network (PEN) represented a significant advancement by jointly modeling text and price data through alignment and shared representation learning. PEN's key innovation was its Text Selection Unit (TSU), which identified salient messages for each trading day, and its Shared Representation Learning (SRL) module, which fused text and price information. This approach not only improved prediction accuracy but also enhanced model explainability by generating a Vector of Salience (VoS) that highlighted influential messages.

However, existing models, including the original PEN, treat the relationship between text and price as unidirectional or implicitly bidirectional. They fail to explicitly model the dual nature of this relationship: text can both drive future price movements (causal influence) and reflect current market conditions (reactive reporting). This limitation affects both prediction accuracy and explainability, particularly during periods of market volatility when the dynamics between text and price become more complex. Furthermore, current models lack mechanisms to adapt to changing market conditions, often performing inconsistently across different volatility regimes.

## Knowledge Gap

Despite these advances, three critical challenges remain unaddressed in current stock prediction models. First, existing approaches do not explicitly distinguish between text that drives price movements and text that merely reflects them, limiting both predictive power and interpretability. Second, models lack adaptive mechanisms to adjust their reliance on different information sources as market conditions change, particularly during periods of high volatility. Third, the causal relationship between text and price is often assumed rather than explicitly modeled, resulting in potentially misleading explanations of prediction decisions. These limitations hinder the practical application of AI-based stock prediction systems in real-world financial decision-making, where explainability and reliability across market conditions are paramount.

## Here We Show

In this paper, we present PEN Dual-Pathway, an enhanced framework that explicitly models the bidirectional relationship between financial text and price movements. Our approach introduces two specialized pathways—a Text-Driven (TD) pathway that identifies influential messages driving future price changes and a Price-Driven (PD) pathway that recognizes text reflecting current market behavior—connected through a volatility-adaptive fusion mechanism. We demonstrate that this architecture achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines while providing pathway-specific explanations that distinguish between text that drives prices versus text that responds to price movements. The model's volatility-adaptive fusion mechanism automatically adjusts pathway importance based on market conditions, improving robustness during periods of high volatility. Through comprehensive experiments on a dataset of 88 stocks with associated tweets spanning three years, we show that PEN Dual-Pathway not only outperforms existing models in accuracy but also provides more nuanced and reliable explanations validated through human expert evaluation. These advances enable more transparent financial prediction systems that can adapt to changing market dynamics while providing detailed explanations of their decision-making process.
